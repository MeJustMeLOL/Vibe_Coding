# Vibe_Coding

An attempt at some "vibe coding" for various tasks rooted in convenience and efficiency.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to:

1. **Scrape and Parse HTML**  
   - Extract HTML content and transform it into readable, structured information.

2. **Feed Information to Neural Networks (CNNs/FNNs)**  
   - Utilize the processed data for training or inference with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs).  
   - Applicable for any HTML or CSS (work in progress).

3. **Merge OCR and OpenAI API**  
   - Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities and OpenAI's API to process and interpret information from websites (completed).

4. **Handle Various File Formats**  
   - Includes modules for processing files like PDF, DOC, and more (completed).

## Purpose

This project addresses a rising demand to combat the spread of fake information. By scraping, analyzing, and using AI tools, the system aims to identify correlations and patterns within data. The backbone of the project is focused on probability-based insights.

## Development Approach

While the backbone of the project was entirely developed by me, I utilized AI to generate code for demonstration purposes. However, most AI-generated code is functional only when built upon my original work (approximately 80%). Despite this, I categorize the project under "Vibe Coding" for its exploratory and adaptive nature.

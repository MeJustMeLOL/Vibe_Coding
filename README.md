# Vibe_Coding
Just attemp to some vibe coding for some stuff for laziness 

this project  is created   to applid  . 

1.it s  simple project to scrap  HTML  and parse it as readable information 
2. the information can be be feed for CNNs or FNNs and can apply for any HTML and CSS ( on going )  
3. it will merge with OCR porject ,  and  open AI API for handle information from website (finished )  
4. it also  with module hanlding file format  , such as PDF , DOC  , and so on  ( finished )
-i make a project  for  a demand is rasising  , that is  a lot fake informations existed nowaday , this project  will scape these information and  using AI to handle  to find  out the  correation point ( it s  probability topic) .
- it s  not really vibe coding because  the back bone of the project is made by me , and i just ask  AI write  a code to demonstrate information .   however  AI code is not good , most of AI code can run always  base  on 80% my code  , despire it  i still put the porject into VIBE_CODING .
